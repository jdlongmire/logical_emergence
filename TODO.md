# 📋 LEH Project TODO

## 🎯 Immediate Priority
- [ ] Resolve all `sorry` in Level 1→2 proofs:
  - [ ] Prove inadequacy of pure logic
  - [ ] Prove necessity of mathematics
  - [ ] Prove uniqueness/minimality (if scoped)
  - [ ] Confirm `lake build` runs without errors or placeholders

## 🚀 Short-Term
- [ ] Publish Level 1→2 result:
  - [ ] Write arXiv/conference-ready manuscript
  - [ ] Archive DOI-tagged Zenodo release after Level 2→3 scaffolded

## 📐 Medium-Term
- [ ] Begin formalization of Level 2→3:
  - [ ] Draft definitions for geometric apparatus
  - [ ] Formalize organizational crisis of mathematics
  - [ ] Scaffold and begin proof structure for Level 2→3

## 📝 Later
- [ ] Expand documentation and collaboration-readiness:
  - [ ] Write contributor guide
  - [ ] Update README and code comments
  - [ ] Prepare to onboard external collaborators

## 🔭 Longer-Term
- [ ] Formalize Level 3→4 and 4→5:
  - [ ] Scaffold and develop proofs beyond Level 2→3

## 📚 Future Research
- [ ] Formalize Papers 2–6 as rigorous proofs
