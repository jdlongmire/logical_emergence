  SECTION 1: Three Fundamental Laws of Logic (3FLL)
  Introduced as axioms (assumed truths).
-/

axiom identity (A : Prop) : A ↔ A
/-
  Identity: Anything is itself.
  For any proposition A, A is logically equivalent to itself.
-/

axiom non_contradiction (A : Prop) : ¬ (A ∧ ¬ A)
/-
  Non-Contradiction: A proposition cannot be both true and false.
  For any proposition A, it’s not possible that A and not-A are both true.
-/

axiom excluded_middle (A : Prop) : A ∨ ¬ A
/-
  Excluded Middle: Every proposition is either true or false.
  For any proposition A, either A is true or not-A is true.

  SECTION 2: Refined Definition of Organizational Coherence

  Organizational coherence means the set of entities
  admits an equivalence relation — a minimal structure
  for distinguishing and relating elements.
-/

def organizational_coherence (α : Type) [fintype α] : Prop :=
  ∃ (r : α → α → Prop), 
    (∀ x, r x x) ∧                 -- reflexivity
    (∀ x y, r x y → r y x) ∧      -- symmetry
    (∀ x y z, r x y ∧ r y z → r x z) -- transitivity

  SECTION 3: Theorem Statement — Multiplicity Crisis

  This theorem claims that once you have more than one distinguishable entity,
  you need some kind of mathematical apparatus to organize their relationships.

    Proof outline:
    1. Assume α is a finite type with more than one element.
    2. Show that distinguishing the elements implies at least one equivalence relation exists.
    3. Such a relation constitutes a minimal mathematical apparatus.
    4. Conclude the existence of such an apparatus M.

  -- Step 1: since card α > 1, there exists at least two distinct elements
  have exists_pair : ∃ (x y : α), x ≠ y,
  { obtain ⟨x, y, hxy⟩ := fintype.exists_ne_of_card_gt_one h,
    use [x, y],
    exact hxy },

  -- Step 2: define a trivial equivalence relation (equality) as minimal structure
  let r : α → α → Prop := λ x y, x = y,

  -- Step 3: show that r is an equivalence relation (trivially)
  have equiv_r : (∀ x, r x x) ∧ (∀ x y, r x y → r y x) ∧ (∀ x y z, r x y ∧ r y z → r x z),
  { split,
    { intro x, refl },
    split,
    { intros x y hxy, rw hxy },
    { intros x y z hxy hyz, rw [hxy, hyz] } },

  -- Step 4: conclude that organizational_coherence holds via r
  have org_coh : organizational_coherence α,
  { use r,
    exact equiv_r },

  -- Step 5: provide M as the type `fin (fintype.card α)`
  use fin (fintype.card α),

  -- Step 6: finish the proof
  intro _,
  exact fin (fintype.card α)
end
