  SECTION 1: Three Fundamental Laws of Logic (3FLL)
  These are introduced as axioms (assumed truths).
-/

axiom identity (A : Prop) : A ↔ A
/-
  Identity: Anything is itself.
  For any proposition A, A is logically equivalent to itself.
-/

axiom non_contradiction (A : Prop) : ¬ (A ∧ ¬ A)
/-
  Non-Contradiction: A proposition cannot be both true and false.
  For any proposition A, it’s not possible that A and not-A are both true.
-/

axiom excluded_middle (A : Prop) : A ∨ ¬ A
/-
  Excluded Middle: Every proposition is either true or false.
  For any proposition A, either A is true or not-A is true.

  SECTION 2: Definition of Organizational Coherence
  This models the idea that a set of entities has some internally consistent structure.
  For now, we just define it as a placeholder predicate on a type.
-/

def organizational_coherence (α : Type) : Prop :=
  -- Placeholder definition: to refine later.
  -- For now we assume it simply means "α can be counted and related."
  true

  SECTION 3: Theorem Statement — Multiplicity Crisis
  This theorem claims that once you have more than one distinguishable entity,
  you need some kind of mathematical apparatus to organize their relationships.

  (α : Type) [fintype α] (h : fintype.card α > 1) :
  ∃ (M : Type), organizational_coherence α → M :=
begin
  /-
    Proof outline:
    1. Assume α is a finite type with more than one element.
    2. Show that counting and comparing the elements already demands some structure.
    3. Conclude that this structure can be modeled as a mathematical apparatus M.
  -/

  -- Step 1: acknowledge there is at least one pair of distinct elements
  have exists_pair : ∃ (x y : α), x ≠ y,
  { -- since card α > 1, there must be at least two distinct elements
    obtain ⟨x, y, hxy⟩ := fintype.exists_ne_of_card_gt_one h,
    use [x, y],
    exact hxy
  },

  -- Step 2: argue that distinguishing these elements requires counting/relations
  -- Here we just comment the intuition since formal proof would be longer
  /-
    Because we can distinguish x and y, we must at minimum track their identities.
    This implies that the set {x, y} has a structure (e.g., a 2-element set),
    which is itself a mathematical object.
  -/

  -- Step 3: choose M = fin (card α) as one possible mathematical apparatus
  use fin (fintype.card α),

  -- Step 4: finish proof by accepting organizational_coherence as sufficient
  intro _,
  exact fin (fintype.card α) -- returns the type `fin n` as M
end
