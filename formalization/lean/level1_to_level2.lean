uses_only_3FLL: (PHASE 2 UPGRADE - was True placeholder)
Asserts that an apparatus M relies solely on the three fundamental laws
of logic (identity, non-contradiction, excluded middle) without
mathematical constructs like numbers, functions, or systematic enumeration.

Asserts that an apparatus M includes mathematical constructs
such as numbers, functions, relations beyond pure logic.

/--
systematic_organization: (PRESERVED FROM PHASE 1)
A property of an apparatus M applied to a type α,
where M enables systematic reference, enumeration, and property attribution.
-/
def systematic_organization (M : Type) (α : Type) : Prop :=
  (∀ x y : α, x = y ∨ x ≠ y) ∧                                -- distinguishability

  (∀ P : α → Prop, ∃ decision : α → Bool,
    ∀ x, P x ↔ decision x = true)                             -- property attribution via decision procedures

/--
finite_multiplicity: (PRESERVED FROM PHASE 1)
A type α has finite multiplicity if it contains more than one distinguishable element.
-/
def finite_multiplicity (α : Type) : Prop :=
  ∃ x y : α, x ≠ y

/--
organizational_crisis: (PRESERVED FROM PHASE 1)
The condition where a multiplicity of entities α imposes demands
that cannot be met by pure logical principles (3FLL) alone.
-/
def organizational_crisis (α : Type) : Prop :=
  finite_multiplicity α ∧                                     -- multiplicity exists

of α, employing mathematical constructs beyond 3FLL.

theorem multiplicity_requires_mathematical_apparatus
  (α : Type)

  /-
    PHASE 2 PROOF SCAFFOLD:
    1. h_crisis gives us finite_multiplicity α AND pure logic inadequacy
    2. Construct M using mathematical apparatus (Nat enumeration + Bool decisions)
    3. Show systematic_organization M α via mathematical structures
    4. Show provides_mathematical_structures M by construction

theorem pure_logic_inadequate_for_multiplicity
  (α : Type) (h : finite_multiplicity α) :
  ¬∃ (M : Type), uses_only_3FLL M ∧ systematic_organization M α := by
  /-
    PHASE 2 PROOF SCAFFOLD:
    1. Assume M uses_only_3FLL (limited to propositional operations)
    2. systematic_organization requires α → Nat injection
    3. Show propositional operations cannot produce systematic enumeration
    4. systematic_organization requires α → Bool property decisions
    5. Show propositional evaluation cannot systematically attribute properties
    6. Contradiction → no such M can exist

theorem mathematical_apparatus_necessarily_emerges
  (α : Type) (h_crisis : organizational_crisis α) :
  ∃ (M : Type), mathematical_apparatus M α := by
  /-
    PHASE 2 PROOF SCAFFOLD:
    1. h_crisis means pure logical apparatus is inadequate
    2. Construct mathematical apparatus M with Nat and Bool structures
    3. Verify M achieves systematic_organization through mathematical tools
    4. Verify M provides_mathematical_structures by construction
    5. Therefore mathematical emergence is necessary

theorem mathematical_apparatus_unique_solution
  (α : Type) (M : Type)
  (h_systematic : systematic_organization M α) :
  provides_mathematical_structures M := by
  /-
    PHASE 2 PROOF SCAFFOLD:
    1. Assume M achieves systematic_organization α
    2. This requires α → Nat injection (mathematical structure needed)
    3. This requires α → Bool decisions (mathematical structure needed)
    4. Any systematic solution must employ mathematical apparatus
    5. Therefore provides_mathematical_structures M necessarily holds
